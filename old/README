(Author - Vilas K Chitrakaran <cvilas@ces.clemson.edu>)


Introduction:
=============

This is the final version of the Ray-Tracer. The following features have 
been added:
  
  1. Soft Shadows 
  		-> Please see kiran_do_lights() in kiran.cpp for implementation
  		-> Example scene file scenes/shadows.env
  		   
  2. Camera movement 
  		-> Please see implementation of class Camera in objects.hpp
  		-> Example scene file scenes/camera.env
  		
  3. Depth of Field 
  		-> Please see getRays() function in class Camera
  		-> Example scene file scenes/dof.env


Program Compilation:
====================

Type 'make' to compile and create the executable kiran. Type 
'./kiran -i <scenefile>' to run the program and create the 
rendered scene as output.ppm. The following command line switches 
can also be used: 
  -o: Specify a name for the output PPM file (instead of the default 
	output.ppm). 
  -i: Specify the input scene file. 
 
(Other global options such as image size, soft shadows and antialiasing
parameters are now specified through the scenefile)
