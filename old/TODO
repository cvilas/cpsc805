Bugs and incomplete features
----------------------------
1. Box intersection and normals 
	- see reflection anomaly 
	- eyepoint should be outside box
2. Quad bump mapping
3. General Polygons
4. Quadrics - cones, hyperbola, ellipse, torus
5. Translation, rotation and scaling - transformation matrix
6. Adaptive anti-aliasing
7. check banding due to diffuse lights.
8. Do code review
9. Optimizations - bounding boxes, faster intersection tests, code cleanups
10. Compose scenes - wine glass, office room, billiard table, golf course

11. math operators problems.
 a)  color.r = (1.0/numRays)*((numRays-1) * color.r + tmpColor.r);
     color.g = (1.0/numRays)*((numRays-1) * color.g + tmpColor.g);
     color.b = (1.0/numRays)*((numRays-1) * color.b + tmpColor.b);
     
 b)  color = (1.0/numRays)*((numRays-1) * color + tmpColor);

 (a) works but (b) does not. Check why.

12. Camera: At low aperture, white lines in refrac.env and cornell.env
