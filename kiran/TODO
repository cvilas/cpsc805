Bugs and incomplete features
----------------------------

1. Optimizations - bounding boxes, faster intersection tests, code cleanups
2. object oriented design for kiran.
3. Compose scenes - wine glass, office room, billiard table, golf course

4. math operators problems.
 a)  color.r = (1.0/numRays)*((numRays-1) * color.r + tmpColor.r);
     color.g = (1.0/numRays)*((numRays-1) * color.g + tmpColor.g);
     color.b = (1.0/numRays)*((numRays-1) * color.b + tmpColor.b);
     
 b)  color = (1.0/numRays)*((numRays-1) * color + tmpColor);

 (a) works but (b) does not. Check why.
