CPSC805 Final Project - Photon mapping
======================================

(Author - Vilas K Chitrakaran <cvilas@ces.clemson.edu>)


Introduction:
=============

The PhotonMap class in PhotonMap.hpp[cpp] provides the implementation for
Photon map structure (almost verbatim Appendix B from Henrik Wann Jensen's 
textbook).

Photon mapping was incorporated into my ray tracer in the following manner:
(All references to functions below are in kiran.cpp)

a) Every Light class object has an object of PhotonMap class.
b) First phase in rendering is photon mapping. kiran_photon_trace() emits 
   photons and calls kiran_recursive_photon_trace(), which upon 
   return provides coordinates for absorbed photons.
c) Scattering of photons happen in kiran_recursive_photon_trace().
d) In the ray tracing phase, kiran_recursive_trace() adds up photon estimates
   from the photon map.

Problems:
=========
I may not be scaling the color/power of photons properly. The photon map
resulting from my implementation is dark. While the caustics show clearly,
color bleeding does not show at all. I have not been able to figure the 
cause of this problem yet.


Program Compilation:
====================

Type 'make' to compile and create the executable kiran. Type 
'./kiran -i <scenefile>' to run the program and create the 
rendered scene as output.ppm. The following command line switches 
can also be used: 
  -o: Specify a name for the output PPM file (instead of the default 
	output.ppm). 
  -i: Specify the input scene file. 
 
Global options such as number of photons per light are specified in the
<Global> section of the scene file.

* The directory 'scenes' contain a scene file cornell.env, a simple cornell
 box with two spheres.

* The directory 'images' contain the following images:
    -> justPhotonMap.png: The photon map created for cornell box
                          by my program
    -> justPhotonMap_bright.png: Artificially enhanced photon map 
                                 image. (BUG: My implementation seems to 
                                 produce dark photon maps)
    -> fullIllum.png: Image of cornell box rendered with photon map
                      and ray tracing.
    -> onlyRayTraced.png: Ray traced image of cornell box without
                          the photon map
